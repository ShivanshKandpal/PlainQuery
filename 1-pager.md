### AI Copilot for Data Teams: 1-Pager

**Problem:**
Data teams spend a significant amount of time on repetitive, low-value tasks like writing boilerplate SQL queries. This delays insights and decision-making. Our project aims to automate this process, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work.

**User:**
The primary users are data analysts, data scientists, and product managers who need to query databases to get insights but may not have the time or expertise to write complex SQL queries.

**Context & Solution:**
We have built an AI-powered web application that translates natural language questions into SQL queries. The application is aware of the database schema, which allows it to generate accurate queries. The system includes advanced safety features, real-time monitoring, and cost management to ensure secure and efficient operations.

**Architecture:**
The application consists of a frontend (HTML/CSS/JS and React/TypeScript), a Flask backend with CORS support, a connection to a SQLite database, and an integration with the Gemini Pro API for natural language processing. It includes features like CSV upload, monitoring dashboard, and multi-layered security.

**Metrics for Success:**
- **Time Saved:** Reduce the time it takes to get answers from the database from minutes/hours to seconds.
- **Query Accuracy:** Achieve a high percentage of correctly generated SQL queries (currently 80%).
- **User Adoption:** Track the number of queries generated through the tool.
- **Cost Efficiency:** Monitor and cap API costs to prevent runaway expenses ($10 limit).
- **Safety:** Maintain 100% protection against data modification through security constraints.

**Next 2 Weeks:**
1.  **Enhance Query Complexity:** Improve the prompt engineering to handle more complex queries, including joins and aggregations.
2.  **Support More Databases:** Add support for other SQL databases like PostgreSQL.
3.  **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
4.  **Visualization:** Add basic data visualization capabilities to the frontend.
5.  **Frontend Integration:** Integrate the advanced React/TypeScript frontend with the backend API.
6.  **Performance Optimization:** Optimize query performance and reduce latency further.
