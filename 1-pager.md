### AI Copilot for Data Teams: 1-Pager

**Problem:**
Data teams spend a significant amount of time on repetitive, low-value tasks like writing boilerplate SQL queries. This delays insights and decision-making. Our project aims to automate this process, allowing teams to focus on higher-value work.

**User:**
The primary users are data analysts, data scientists, and product managers who need to query databases to get insights but may not have the time or expertise to write complex SQL queries.

**Context & Solution:**
We have built an AI-powered web application that translates natural language questions into SQL queries. The application is aware of the database schema, which allows it to generate accurate queries.

**Architecture:**
The application consists of a frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), a Flask backend, a connection to a SQLite database, and an integration with the Gemini Pro API for natural language processing.

**Metrics for Success:**
- **Time Saved:** Reduce the time it takes to get answers from the database from minutes/hours to seconds.
- **Query Accuracy:** Achieve a high percentage of correctly generated SQL queries.
- **User Adoption:** Track the number of queries generated through the tool.

**Next 2 Weeks:**
1.  **Enhance Query Complexity:** Improve the prompt engineering to handle more complex queries, including joins and aggregations.
2.  **Support More Databases:** Add support for other SQL databases like PostgreSQL.
3.  **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
4.  **Visualization:** Add basic data visualization capabilities to the frontend.
